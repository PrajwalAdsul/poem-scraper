Inscription
    For Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg
To them who crossed the flood
And climbed the hill, with eyes
    Upon the heavenly flag intent,
    And through the deathful tumult went
Even unto death: to them this Stone—
Erect, where they were overthrown—
    Of more than victory the monument.
