And whom do I call my enemy? An enemy must be worthy of engagement.I turn in the direction of the sun and keep walking.It’s the heart that asks the question, not my furious mind.The heart is the smaller cousin of the sun.It sees and knows everything.It hears the gnashing even as it hears the blessing.The door to the mind should only open from the heart.An enemy who gets in, risks the danger of becoming a friend.
