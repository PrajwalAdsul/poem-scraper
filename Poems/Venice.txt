Venice
With Pantheist energy of will
The little craftsman of the Coral Sea
Strenuous in the blue abyss,
Up-builds his marvellous gallery
    And long arcade,
Erections freaked with many a fringe
    Of marble garlandry,
Evincing what a worm can do.p>
Laborious in a shallower wave,
    Advanced in kindred art,
A prouder agent proved Panâ€™s might
When Venice rose in reefs of palaces.
